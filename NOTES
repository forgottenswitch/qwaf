Non- xkb/xkeyboard-config -standard filenames are so that
`xkbcomp` would not see them as system ones
(it only has #include"", but not #include<>).

Compile-test (via xkbcomp) with 'make test'.

To regenerate README images, run "make pic".
This will need ImageMagick installed (for its "convert" program).
